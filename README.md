In the lab, organoids are filmed and analyzed by software that extracts their area in pixels.
This program converts the measured pixel area to mm² using the formula
Area (mm²) = (2.1462 × pixel area) / 1,000,000,
and normalizes it according to another given value.

It includes three input methods:

Interactive input – the user types the values when prompted.

Command line arguments – values are given directly in the terminal.

GUI (Tkinter) – a graphical interface with two input fields and a calculate button.

I used GitHub Copilot (GPT-4) to help generate and refine the code.
Prompt used:

“Generate a Python program that converts pixel area to mm² and normalizes it by another value, with interactive input, command-line arguments, and a Tkinter GUI.”
